/// Try to receive an event from a `Stream`'s asynchronous poll expression.
///
/// This macro is similar to the `try_ready!` macro provided in `futures`. If there is an event
/// ready, it will be returned wrapped in a `Result`. If there are no events ready to be received,
/// the outer function will return with a transition that indicates that no events were received,
/// which is analogous to `Async::NotReady`.
///
/// When the asynchronous event indicates that the stream has finished or that it has failed, an
/// error type is returned so that either close scenario can be handled in a similar way.
